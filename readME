/*
I created a fork of the original project on my account. There are branches for each collaborator including the master branch. 
Our primary code editor is PSOC Creator 4.2 since it includes source code and the associated components.
The program is written in C. The primary file is "main.c" where .c are files containing source code and .h are files containing the associated headers.
